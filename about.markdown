Welcome to the personal website of Benjamin Hinchliff. I'm a computer scientist
and masters graduate student at Cal Poly SLO, with an interest in many topics
including security, operating systems, and machine learning. I've a
long-standing interesting in computers and have been programming from a young
age, around middle school.

I also like cats, specifically our cats Harry and Humbug, video games
(especially Starcraft), and all kinds of media, especially books and webnovels.
A couple favorites are Martha Wells' [*Murderbot
Diaries*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Murderbot_Diaries), Arkady Martine's
[*A Memory Called Empire*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Memory_Called_Empire)
(thanks to my sister reccomending it), Guiltythree's [Shadow
Slave](https://www.webnovel.com/book/shadow-slave_22196546206090805), and
Temple's [REND](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32615/rend).
