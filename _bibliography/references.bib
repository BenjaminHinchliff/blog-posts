	abstract = {The unprecedented surge in video data production in recent years necessitates efficient tools to extract meaningful frames from videos for downstream tasks. Long-term temporal reasoning is a key desideratum for frame retrieval systems. While state-of-the-art foundation models, like VideoLLaMA and ViCLIP, are proficient in short-term semantic understanding, they surprisingly fail at long-term reasoning across frames. A key reason for this failure is that they intertwine per-frame perception and temporal reasoning into a single deep network. Hence, decoupling but co-designing the semantic understanding and temporal reasoning is essential for efficient scene identification. We propose a system that leverages vision-language models for semantic understanding of individual frames and effectively reasons about the long-term evolution of events using state machines and temporal logic (TL) formulae that inherently capture memory. Our TL-based reasoning improves the F1 score of complex event identification by 9–15\%, compared to benchmarks that use GPT-4 for reasoning, on state-of-the-art self-driving datasets such as Waymo and NuScenes.

	abstract = {The goal of the growing discipline of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence (AI) is to develop AI systems with more human-like reasoning capabilities by combining symbolic reasoning with connectionist learning. We survey the literature on neuro-symbolic AI during the last two decades, including books, monographs, review papers, contribution pieces, opinion articles, foundational workshops/talks, and related PhD theses. Four main features of neuro-symbolic AI are discussed, including representation, learning, reasoning, and decision-making. Finally, we discuss the many applications of neuro-symbolic AI, including question answering, robotics, computer vision, healthcare, and more. Scalability, explainability, and ethical considerations are also covered, as well as other difficulties and limits of neuro-symbolic AI. This study summarizes the current state of the art in neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence.},

	abstract = {Formal verification has emerged as a powerful approach to ensure the safety and reliability of deep neural networks. However, current verification tools are limited to only a handful of properties that can be expressed as first-order constraints over the inputs and output of a network. While adversarial robustness and fairness fall under this category, many real-world properties (e.g., "an autonomous vehicle has to stop in front of a stop sign") remain outside the scope of existing verification technology. To mitigate this severe practical restriction, we introduce a novel framework for verifying neural networks, named neuro-symbolic verification. The key idea is to use neural networks as part of the otherwise logical specification, enabling the verification of a wide variety of complex, real-world properties, including the one above. Moreover, we demonstrate how neuro-symbolic verification can be implemented on top of existing verification infrastructure for neural networks, making our framework easily accessible to researchers and practitioners alike.},
